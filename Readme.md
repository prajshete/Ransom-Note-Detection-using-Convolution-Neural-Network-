#Ransom-Note-Detection-using-Convolution-Neural-Network


- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect ransomware attacks through image classification of ransom notes, enhancing cybersecurity defenses.
- Implemented a deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving a model architecture with multiple layers including convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout layers for efficient image processing.
- Trained the model on a dataset of 208 images, achieving initial success in classifying ransomware-related images, with plans for further accuracy improvements.
- Planned future enhancements to extend the model's capabilities for classifying ransom notes in .txt format by exploring NLP and character-based CNN or LSTM methods, aiming to improve detection versatility and accuracy
